	<p>The pattern below is a very basic top-down sock knit entirely in stockinette stitch. It is recommended to add some type of ribbing at the top of the cuff (or the whole cuff) to keep the socks from falling down. Feel free to experiment with stitch patterns and your own designs, but know that the gauge and stitch counts will have to be adjusted along with any pattern alterations</p>
